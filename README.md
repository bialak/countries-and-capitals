Hi,


In this project you can try yourself with connnecting capital to country. I found this exercise in the internet and i wanted to check my skills. If you want to look at my code or play game there are steps what you need to do : 

1. Write git clone in terminal https://github.com/bialak/countries-and-capitals.git.
2. Write command git install.
3. If you will see errors in terminal ,you may need to downgrade your TypeScript version. To install a compatible version, run: npm install typescript@4.9.5 --save-dev.
4. All you need to do is write in the terminal: npm start  and open the browser.


Enjoy the game ! :D
